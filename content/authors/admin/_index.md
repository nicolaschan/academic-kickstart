Iâ€™m currently an operations intern at [Berkeley Research Computing](https://research-it.berkeley.edu/blog/17/12/21/success-stories-brc%E2%80%99s-undergraduate-ops-internship-program), developing tools for and assisting researchers with supercomputing in close affiliation with the [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab](https://www.lbl.gov) HPCS team.

Previously, I worked for [SGT](http://www.sgt-inc.com) as a contractor at NASA Ames Research Center, working on the [Mission Tools Suite](https://mts.nasa.gov) to support the airborne science program.

In 2015, I was part of the educational associates program by USRA, also at NASA Ames, primarily working on user interface design for a winter weather dashboard for airline dispatchers.
